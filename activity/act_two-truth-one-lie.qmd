The following activity demonstrates **probability calibration**.

## [[Team]]{.blue} Activity: Two truths and a lie [^2]

[^2]: [Active Statistics, Page 179](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/ActiveStatistics.pdf).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| column: margin
knitr::include_graphics("../images/QRCode_truth.png")
```

Within your group:

1. One person tells three personal statements one of which is a lie.

2. Others discuss and guess which statement is the lie and they jointly construct a numerical statement of their **certainty** in the guess on a 0â€“10 scale.

3. The storyteller reveals which was the lie.

4. Enter the certainty estimate and the outcome success or failure and submit in the [Microsoft form](https://forms.office.com/r/J6dwWdvfc0).

5. Rotate through everyone in your group so that each person plays the storyteller role once.

## How strong will the relation be between $x$ and $y$: what will the curve look like?
