- How can we show the current date every time we compile the file? *\[Hint:\]* Check your *hw00*. Compile your document and make sure the date shows up.

- How do we [hide the code](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html#code) so that the document is shorter? Describe it in `## Lab 2: Quarto`
