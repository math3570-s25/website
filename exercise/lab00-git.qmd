# Git Ready for Data Science

- Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) to create a GitHub account if you don't have one. 
  - Use the **same** username and email address of your Posit Cloud.

- **Account (topright) > Settings**
  - `r fa("envelope") `  **Emails** > *Uncheck* "Keep my email address private" (Link your R/Python work to GitHub)
  - `r fa("user") `  **Public Profile** > Cool name and nice picture!

- Share your GitHub **username** at <https://forms.office.com/r/k0L5M5TyS7>, so I can invite you to join our course organization **math3570-s24**.


- Please accept my invitation to join the GitHub organization **math3570-s24**.

```{r}
#| label: join-org

```


# Connecting Posit Cloud and GitHub Together

## Connect Posit Cloud and GitHub: Step 1

- Posit Cloud cannot recognize your GitHub account unless you connect them each other.

- In Posit Cloud, click on your name on the top-right corner to open the right menu.

- Click on **Authentication**.

```{r}
#| label: github-auth-1
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/github-auth-1-23.png")
```


## Connect Posit Cloud and GitHub: Step 2
- In the Authentication window, check the box for **Enabled**.

```{r}
#| label: github-auth-2
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/github-auth-2-23.png")
```

When check Enabled, will jump to GitHub page shown in the next.


## Connect Posit Cloud and GitHub: Step 3
-  For your GitHub page, click on the green box that says "**Authorize rstudio**".

```{r}
#| label: github-auth-3
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/github-auth-3-23.png")
```



## Connect Posit Cloud and GitHub: Step 4

- Back to the Authentication of Posit Cloud, check **Private repo access also enabled**.

- Make sure **math3570-s24** shows up under **Organization access**. 

- Click on **Request**

- Click on the green box "**Authorize rstudio**".


```{r}
#| label: github-auth-4
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/github-auth-4-24.png")
```

When check Private repo access also enabled, will jump to GitHub page as shown.

## Connect Posit Cloud and GitHub: Step 5
- Once you're done, both of these boxes should be checked.

```{r}
#| label: github-auth-5
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/github-auth-5-23.png")
```

## Connect Posit Cloud and GitHub: Step 5-1

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/org-access.png")
```


## Connect Posit Cloud and GitHub: Step 6

- Confirm that you've linked up your GitHub and Posit Cloud accounts [GitHub settings > Applications](https://github.com/settings/applications). Should see Posit Cloud listed as an authorized app under *Authorized OAuth Apps*.


```{r}
#| label: github-auth-6
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/github-auth-6-23.png")
```

If you see RStudio is under the Authorized Apps, congratulations! Your RStudio and GitHub are now linked together!


# GitHub to Posit Cloud

## GitHub to Posit Cloud: Step 1
- Each of your assignments will begin with the following steps.
- Go to the repo named **hw00-yourusername** I created for you.

```{r}
#| label: hw-repo
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/hw00_repo_2024.png")
```



## GitHub to Posit Cloud: Step 2

- On GitHub, 
  + click on the green **Code** button, select **HTTPS**. 
  + click on the clipboard icon on the right to copy the repo URL, such as  `https://github.com/math3570-s24/hw00-chenghanyu.git`


```{r}
#| label: clone-repo-link
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/clone-repo-link-2024.png")
```


## GitHub to Posit Cloud: Step 3
- Go to Posit Cloud and into the course workspace **2024-spring-math-3570**. 
- Create a **New Project from Git Repo**.

```{r}
#| label: new-project-from-option
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/new-project-option-24.png")
```

You will need to click on the down arrow next to the **New Project** button to see this option.


## GitHub to Posit Cloud: Step 4
- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box.
- Hit `OK`, and you're good to go!

```{r}
#| fig-width: 5
#| label: paste-gh-repo-url
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/paste-gh-repo-url-2024.png")
```



## GitHub to Posit Cloud: Step 5
- Click **hw00-yourusername** to do your assignment in Posit Cloud!

```{r}
#| label: rcloud-project
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/rcloud_project_hw00_2024.png")
```

- Done! We learned the entire process of cloning a repo on GitHub to Posit Cloud as a project.

- Next, we'll see how to keep your revision record (**commit**) and send (**push**) the latest revised version of your work from Posit Cloud to GitHub!


# Posit Cloud to GitHub

## Personal Access Token (PAT): Step 1
- GitHub has removed the support for Password Authentication for Git operations.

- Before we can send our work in Posit Cloud to GitHub, we need **Personal Access Token (PAT)**

- **Settings > Developer settings**

```{r}
#| label: pat-1
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/pat_1.png")
```


GitHub has removed the support for Password Authentication for Git operations for more safety from 08/13/2021.
 

## Personal Access Token (PAT): Step 2

```{r}
#| label: pat-2
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/pat_2-23.png")
```



## Personal Access Token (PAT): Step 3
```{r}
#| label: pat-3
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/pat_3-23.png")
```



## Personal Access Token (PAT): Step 4
```{r}
#| label: pat-4
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/pat_4-23.png")
```



## Personal Access Token (PAT): Step 5
- Copy and paste your PAT to a [*secrete and safe space*]{.blue}!!

```{r}
#| label: pat-5
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/pat_5-23.png")
```




## Posit Cloud to GitHub: Step 1 - Edit your file

- Open a **Quarto (qmd)** file in your project, in YAML change the author name to your name.

- Click **Render** to generate your beautiful document. (If you are asked to install any packages, please do!)

```{r}
#| label: yaml-raw-to-rendered
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/yaml-raw-to-rendered_hw00-24.png")
```





## Posit Cloud to GitHub: Step 2 - Commit changes

- Go to the Git tab in your RStudio. 
- Click on **Diff**. This shows you the **diff**erence between the last committed state of the document and its current state that includes your changes.
- Check **Staged** box to add files to be committed.
- Write "*Update author's name*" in the **Commit message** box and hit **Commit**.

```{r}
#| label: update-author-name-commit
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/update-author-name-commit-2023.png")
```

<!-- You don’t have to commit after every change, this would get quite cumbersome. You should consider committing states that are meaningful to you for inspection, comparison, or restoration. In the first few assignments we will tell you exactly when to commit and in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses we will let you make these decisions. -->


## Posit Cloud to GitHub: Step 3 - Push changes
- We've made an update and committed this change *locally*. 
- It’s time to **push** the changes to your repo on GitHub, so that others (Dr. Yu) can see your changes. 
- Click on **Push**.
- In the prompted dialogue box, enter your *GitHub user name*, and your *password (PAT)*.

```{r}
#| label: update-author-name-commit-push
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/update-author-name-commit-2023.png")
```

## Posit Cloud to GitHub: Step 3 - Updated Repo

- Back to your GitHub repo and refresh it.

- The online repo is now *synced* with your local project in Posit Cloud.


```{r}
#| label: update-repo
knitr::include_graphics("../slides/images/04-git/update-repo-2024.png")
```
