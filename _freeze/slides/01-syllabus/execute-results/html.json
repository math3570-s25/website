I hope you have a great winter break. Welcome to 3570 Introduction to Data Science course. I am your instructor Cheng-Han Yu.  \n\n- First thing first. Get to know each other. Let me first introduce my self. I was born and grew up in Taipei, Taiwan, my home country, which is a island right next to China. Taipei is a big city in terms of population. It is about the same population size as Chicago. This building is called Taipei 101, which is the tallest building in Taiwan.\n:::\n\n\n\n## My Journey {background-image=\"images/01-syllabus/sample_gate.png\" background-size=\"cover\" background-position=\"50% 50%\" background-opacity=\"0.3\"}\n\n-   Assistant Professor (2020/08 - )\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/mu.svg){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   Postdoctoral Fellow\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/rice.png){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   PhD in Statistics\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/ucsc.png){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   MA in Economics/PhD program in Statistics\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/iub.png){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: notes\nAfter college, working and doing military service for several years, I came to the US for my PhD degree. Originally I would like to study economics, but then I switched my major to statistics. \n\n- I got my master degree in economics from Indiana University Bloomington, then I transferred to UC Santa Cruz to finish my PhD studies. \n- Then I spent two years doing my postdoctoral research at Rice University in Houston, Texas.\n- Finally, in fall 2020, I came to Marquette as an assistant professor.\n- Midwest/Indiana-West/California-South/Texas-Midwest/Wisconsin\n- Been to any one of these universities/cities? \n- The most beautiful campus.\n- Who are international students? I can totally understand how hard studying and living in another country. Feel free to share your stories or difficulties, and I am more than happy to help you if you have any questions.\n- Poor listening and speaking skills. I was shy. \n- OK so, this is my background. How about you introducing yourself as well. You can share anything, your major, hobbies, your favorite food, what do you want to do after graduation, anything, \n- I have the class list. I'd like to learn your face and remember your name. You know, you all wear a mask. It's hard to recognize you and connect your name and your face. \n- When I call your name, you can say something about yourself. No need to be long, couple of seconds are good.\n:::\n\n\n\n## How to Reach Me\n\n- Office hours **TuTh 4:50 - 5:50 PM** and **Wed 12 - 1 PM** in **Cudahy Hall 353**.\n- üìß  <cheng-han.yu@marquette.edu> \n  + Answer your question within 24 hours. \n  + Expect a reply on **Monday** if shoot me a message **on weekends**.\n  + Start your subject line with **[math3570]** or **[cosc3570]** followed by a **clear description of your question**. \n  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/3570_email.png){fig-align='center' width=45%}\n:::\n:::\n\n  + I will **NOT** reply your e-mail if ... **Check the email policy in the [syllabus](https://math3570-s25.github.io/website/course-syllabus.html)**!\n\n\n## When You Have Two Dr. Yu in One Semester üòÇ {visibility=\"hidden\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/email_example_student.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/email_example.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: notes\n- This is a real case happened last semester. A student of my class sent her homework of another class linear systems to me because the instructor of that course also has last name Yu, and she messed up. So if you remember to add course number in the subject line, it will greatly reduce the possibility of sending a wrong message. And it will save your time and my time, and so we all can work more efficiently.

We learn how to **code for doing data science**, not for understanding computer systems and structures.\n\n::: notes\n- Of course we will not cover every detail form A to Z of DS in one semester becuase DS is such a huge subject, just like computer science. It's impossible to learn CS in one semester by just taking intro to CS, right?

We discuss it, then decide.\n\n\n<br>\n\n. . .\n\n‚ùì **Will this class help me better understand how to code proficiently?**  \nüëâ As you learn to speak a foreign language, you need to code a lot, frequently and constantly in order to be proficient in any programming language. No shortcut.\n\n<br>\n\n. . .\n\n‚ùì **Do you know of any internships or research positions offered through Marquette University that incorporate the skills learned in this Data Science course?**  \nüëâ Quite many. Northwestern Mutual, Direct Supply, for example. I'll share intern info with you if I get any.\n\n. . .\n\n<br>\n\n\n‚ùì **More questions**\n\n[Bring your laptop next time!]{.r-fit-text .fragment style=\"color: #EE6331;\"}\n\n\n<!-- # ü§ù Please read the syllabus!!!
