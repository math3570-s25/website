Milwaukee Bucks and Golden State Warriors are playing NBA Finals 🏆. The first to win four games wins the series. The Bucks are a better team and have a 60% chance of winning each game. If the Bucks lose the **first two games**, calculate the probability that the Bucks win the NBA championship?  -->\n\n<!-- **[Hint]**: You can use binomial distribution, and given the first two games loss, the probability $P(\\text{Bucks wins the series})$ is -->\n\n<!-- $$P(\\text{Bucks wins 4 in a row}) + P(\\text{Bucks wins 4 in 5 games})$$ -->\n\n<!-- ```{r} -->\n\n<!-- ## code -->\n\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n<!-- 2. Confirm the results of the previous question using a Monte Carlo simulation. -->\n\n<!-- ```{r} -->\n\n<!-- ## code -->\n\n<!-- # set.seed(your ID number) -->\n\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n1.  Suppose you are in a classroom with 30 people. If we assume this is a randomly selected group of 30 people, what is the chance that at least two people have the same birthday? Here we use a Monte Carlo simulation. For simplicity, we assume nobody was born on February 29.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n\ni.  Note that birthdays can be represented as numbers between 1 and 365, so a sample of 30 birthdays can be obtained like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn <- 30\nbdays <- sample(x = 1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nii. To check if in this particular set of 30 people we have at least two with the same birthday, we can use the function `duplicated()`, which returns `TRUE` whenever an element of a vector is a duplicate. Here is an example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nduplicated(c(1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe second time 1 and 3 appear, we get a `TRUE`.\n\niii. To check if two birthdays were the same, we simply use the `any()` and `duplicated()` functions like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nany(duplicated(bdays))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this case, we see that it did happen. At least two people had the same birthday.\n\nTo estimate the probability of a shared birthday in the group, repeat this experiment by sampling sets of 30 birthdays 10000 times, and find the relative frequency of the event that at least two people had the same birthday.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## code\n# set.seed(your ID number)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Central Limit Theorem\n\nSuppose random variables $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n$ are independent and follow Chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom 1, $\\chi^2_{df=1}$.\n\n1.  Use `dchisq()` to plot $\\chi^2_{df=1}$ distribution. Consider $x\\in (0, 5)$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## code\n```\n:::\n\n\n2.  Consider three sample sizes $n = 2, 8, 100$, and set the sample size of the sample mean $\\overline{X}_n$ be $1000$. Show the sampling distribution of $\\overline{X}_n$, i.e., the collection $\\{\\overline{X}_n^{(m)}\\}_{m=1}^{1000}$, looks more and more like Gaussian as $n$ increases by making histograms of $\\overline{X}_n$ samples with $n = 2, 8, 100$. The procedure is the following:\n\nFor each $n = 2, 8, 100$,\n\ni.  Draw $n$ values $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$ using `rchisq(n, df = 1)`.\nii. Compute the mean of the $n$ values, which is $\\overline{x}_n$.\niii. Repeat i. and ii. 1000 times to obtain 1000 $\\overline{x}_n$s.\niv. Plot the histogram of these 1000 $\\overline{x}_n$s.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## code\n# set.seed(your ID number)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Machine Learning\n\n## Linear Regression\n\nA pharmaceutical firm would like to obtain information on the relationship between the dose level and potency of a drug product. To do this, each of 15 test tubes is inoculated with a virus culture and incubated for 5 days at 30°C. Three test tubes are randomly assigned to each of the five different dose levels to be investigated (2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 mg). Each tube is injected with only one dose level, and the response of interest is obtained.\n\n1.  Import [`dose.csv`](./dose.csv) into your working session. The data set is not tidy.
