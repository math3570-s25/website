The training data are shown as cat or dog images, and there are three test data to be labeled: [green]{.green}, [red]{.red}, and [blue]{.blue} points.\n\nConsider K Nearest Neighbors with $K = 1, 2, 3, 4$, and discuss the following questions.\n\n## Discussion\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## For which test data point, the classification result is uncertain or unstable?\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## Which data point can be labelled as one particular category with 100% certainty, for all different $K$s?\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## For the blue point, what happened when $K$ increases? Do we change the prediction? What about uncertainty?\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## If you would like to make a classification rule or set the decision boundary to predict cats or dogs, what would the decision boundary look like? Why?\n\n:::\n",
