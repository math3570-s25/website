One person tells three personal statements one of which is a lie.\n\n2. Others discuss and guess which statement is the lie and they jointly construct a numerical statement of their **certainty** in the guess on a 0â€“10 scale.\n\n3. The storyteller reveals which was the lie.\n\n4. Enter the certainty estimate and the outcome success or failure and submit in the [Microsoft form](https://forms.office.com/r/J6dwWdvfc0).\n\n5. Rotate through everyone in your group so that each person plays the storyteller role once.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## What do you think the range of centainty scores will look like?\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## Will there be a positive relation between $x$ and binary $y$: are guesses with higher certainty be more accurate, on average?\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## How strong will the relation be between $x$ and $y$: what will the curve look like?\n\n\n:::",
