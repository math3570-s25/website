Everyone is given the same opportunity to do well in this class. I may use class participation to make grade adjustments at the end of the semester.\nThe final grade is based on the grade-percentage conversion Table 1 on the next page. \\([x, y)\\) means greater than or equal to \\(x\\) and less than \\(y\\). For example, 94.1 is in \\([94, 100]\\) and the grade is A and 93.8 is in \\([90, 94)\\) and the grade is A-.\n\n\n\n\nGrade-Percentage Conversion\n\n\nGrade\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nA\n[94, 100]\n\n\nA-\n[90, 94)\n\n\nB+\n[87, 90)\n\n\nB\n[83, 87)\n\n\nB-\n[80, 83)\n\n\nC+\n[77, 80)\n\n\nC\n[73, 77)\n\n\nC-\n[70, 73)\n\n\nD+\n[65, 70)\n\n\nD\n[60, 65)\n\n\nF\n[0, 60)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLab exercises\n\nThere are several in-class lab exercises, which are graded as complete/incomplete and used as evidence of attendance and class participation.\nYou are allowed to have one incomplete lab exercise without penalty. Beyond that, 2% grade percentage will be taken off for each missing/incomplete exercise.\n\n\n\n\nHomework\n\nThe homework assignments are individual. You should submit your own work.\nYou may not directly share or discuss answers/code with anyone other than the instructor. But you are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice.\nHomework will be assigned through GitHub. You need to clone/pull the homework repo into Posit Cloud and work on the Quarto file in the repo. A step-by-step guide will be discussed in class before homework is assigned.\nYou will have at least one week to complete your assignment.\nNo make-up homework for any reason unless you have excused absences.\nIf you miss a homework assignment due to excused absence, the homework percentage will be added to your final project. If you miss more than one assignment, only one assignment percentage can be added to the final project percentage. You get 0% for the other assignment.\n\n\n\nMidterm mini project\n\nYou will be team up to do the midterm mini project.\nMore details about the mini project presentation will be released later.\n\n\n\nFinal project competition\n\nYou will be team up to do the final project. Your project can be in either of the following categories:\n\nData analysis using statistical models or machine learning algorithms\nIntroduce a R or Python package not learned in class, including live demo\nIntroduce a data science tool (visualization, computing, etc) not learned in class, including live demo\nIntroduce a programming language not learned in class for doing data science, including live demo, Julia, SQL, MATLAB, SAS for example.\nWeb development: Shiny website or dashboard, including live demo\n\nDetails about the project will be provided as the course progresses. You must complete the final project and be in class to present it in order to pass this course.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final project presentation is on Thursday, May 1, 2 PM and Monday, May 5, 10:30 AM - 12:30 PM.",

Then we learn data importing, data visualization and data wrangling using both R and Python. The second half of the course focuses on several basic simulation and machine learning methods, including Monte Carlo simulation, linear regression, K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, principal component analysis, and K-means clustering. We learn R tidyverse and tidymodels packages. For Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn libraries are introduced.",

If we assume this is a randomly selected group of 30 people, what is the chance that at least two people have the same birthday? Here we use a Monte Carlo simulation. For simplicity, we assume nobody was born on February 29.\n\n\n\nNote that birthdays can be represented as numbers between 1 and 365, so a sample of 30 birthdays can be obtained like this:\n\n\nn &lt;- 30\nbdays &lt;- sample(x = 1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)\n\n\nTo check if in this particular set of 30 people we have at least two with the same birthday, we can use the function duplicated(), which returns TRUE whenever an element of a vector is a duplicate. Here is an example:\n\n\nduplicated(c(1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 5))\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nThe second time 1 and 3 appear, we get a TRUE.\n\nTo check if two birthdays were the same, we simply use the any() and duplicated() functions like this:\n\n\nany(duplicated(bdays))\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nIn this case, we see that it did happen. At least two people had the same birthday.\nTo estimate the probability of a shared birthday in the group, repeat this experiment by sampling sets of 30 birthdays 10000 times, and find the relative frequency of the event that at least two people had the same birthday.\n\n## code\n# set.seed(your ID number)"

For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\nAdapter’s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nBY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.\nCopyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized.

Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\n\nSection 2 – Scope.\n\nLicense grant.\n\nSubject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\nA. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\nB. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\nExceptions and Limitations.

The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures.

Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material.

In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\n\n\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\nAttribution.\n\nIf You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\nA. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n\nidentification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\na copyright notice;\na notice that refers to this Public License;\na notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\na URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n\nB. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\nC. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\nYou may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material.

You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.\nYou may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter’s License You apply.\n\n\n\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\nfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\nif You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\nYou must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\nUnless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\nTo the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n\n\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n\n\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\n\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

    "text": "A Little History of Data Science\n\nIn 1985, Dr. Jeff Wu used the term Data Science for the first time as an alternative name for Statistics.  \n\n\n\n\nThe first question is What is DS? Actually this is a really hard question to answer, at least at this moment.\n\nOriginally, DS was proposed to replace statistics. DS is just another name or maybe better name for statistics.\n\n\nBut still at that time, nobody cares. Statisticians are weird guys in math departments who deal with proofs and theorems and sometimes real data, and they are stubborn, not willing to change. But if you wiki the definition of statistics, statistics is a science of data, and you tell me what is the difference of science of data and data science?\n\n\nUsing this definition, DS becomes a broader term than statistics. Anything related to data can be a part of data sicence, while statistics now becomes a narrower subject focusing on inference and data analysis part.\n\nHere shows the google trend of DS. When I was in college or beginning of PHD studies, very few people used DS as a term. And all of sudden, DS become more and more popular, and everybody is talking about it."

And that’s probably why you don’t learn R in an intro programming course.\nSo you can view Python as a smart phone. It can do many different things, phone, camera, email, social media. But R is like a high quality camera. You cannot use it to write emails, text messages, but it produces high quality photos.\nRStudio is not a programming language, but a software application.\nCode itself is just a text file. You can use any text editor or software to write your code.\nSo RStudio makes programming in R more easily and efficiently. It provides so many useful functions for you that doing data science becomes a piece of cake.\nToday, You are gonna have a chance to play with different panes and functions in RStudio. OK."
