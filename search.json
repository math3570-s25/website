Everyone is given the same opportunity to do well in this class. I may use class participation to make grade adjustments at the end of the semester.\nThe final grade is based on the grade-percentage conversion Table 1 on the next page. \\([x, y)\\) means greater than or equal to \\(x\\) and less than \\(y\\). For example, 94.1 is in \\([94, 100]\\) and the grade is A and 93.8 is in \\([90, 94)\\) and the grade is A-.\n\n\n\n\nGrade-Percentage Conversion\n\n\nGrade\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nA\n[94, 100]\n\n\nA-\n[90, 94)\n\n\nB+\n[87, 90)\n\n\nB\n[83, 87)\n\n\nB-\n[80, 83)\n\n\nC+\n[77, 80)\n\n\nC\n[73, 77)\n\n\nC-\n[70, 73)\n\n\nD+\n[65, 70)\n\n\nD\n[60, 65)\n\n\nF\n[0, 60)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLab exercises\n\nThere are several in-class lab exercises, which are graded as complete/incomplete and used as evidence of attendance and class participation.\nYou are allowed to have one incomplete lab exercise without penalty. Beyond that, 2% grade percentage will be taken off for each missing/incomplete exercise.\n\n\n\n\nHomework\n\nThe homework assignments are individual. You should submit your own work.\nYou may not directly share or discuss answers/code with anyone other than the instructor. But you are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice.\nHomework will be assigned through GitHub. You need to clone/pull the homework repo into Posit Cloud and work on the Quarto file in the repo. A step-by-step guide will be discussed in class before homework is assigned.\nYou will have at least one week to complete your assignment.\nNo make-up homework for any reason unless you have excused absences.\nIf you miss a homework assignment due to excused absence, the homework percentage will be added to your final project. If you miss more than one assignment, only one assignment percentage can be added to the final project percentage. You get 0% for the other assignment.\n\n\n\nMidterm mini project\n\nYou will be team up to do the midterm mini project.\nMore details about the mini project presentation will be released later.\n\n\n\nFinal project competition\n\nYou will be team up to do the final project. Your project can be in either of the following categories:\n\nData analysis using statistical models or machine learning algorithms\nIntroduce a R or Python package not learned in class, including live demo\nIntroduce a data science tool (visualization, computing, etc) not learned in class, including live demo\nIntroduce a programming language not learned in class for doing data science, including live demo, Julia, SQL, MATLAB, SAS for example.\nWeb development: Shiny website or dashboard, including live demo\n\nDetails about the project will be provided as the course progresses. You must complete the final project and be in class to present it in order to pass this course.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final project presentation is on Thursday, May 1, 2 PM and Monday, May 5, 10:30 AM - 12:30 PM.",

And that’s probably why you don’t learn R in an intro programming course.\nSo you can view Python as a smart phone. It can do many different things, phone, camera, email, social media. But R is like a high quality camera. You cannot use it to write emails, text messages, but it produces high quality photos.\nRStudio is not a programming language, but a software application.\nCode itself is just a text file. You can use any text editor or software to write your code.\nSo RStudio makes programming in R more easily and efficiently.

At the end, it’s everything like final, final3, final10, final_last whatever, it just keeps going.\nThe thing is these file names are not really very informative because final or final revisions don’t really say anything.\nBut if you really had tagged the changes you make between the final and the final 2, that could actually be informative if you actually have to go back to them."

Originally I would like to study economics, but then I switched my major to statistics.\n\nI got my master degree in economics from Indiana University Bloomington, then I transferred to UC Santa Cruz to finish my PhD studies.\nThen I spent two years doing my postdoctoral research at Rice University in Houston, Texas.\nFinally, in fall 2020, I came to Marquette as an assistant professor.\nMidwest/Indiana-West/California-South/Texas-Midwest/Wisconsin\nBeen to any one of these universities/cities?\nThe most beautiful campus.\nWho are international students? I can totally understand how hard studying and living in another country. Feel free to share your stories or difficulties, and I am more than happy to help you if you have any questions.\nPoor listening and speaking skills. I was shy.\nOK so, this is my background. How about you introducing yourself as well. You can share anything, your major, hobbies, your favorite food, what do you want to do after graduation, anything,\nI have the class list. I’d like to learn your face and remember your name. You know, you all wear a mask. It’s hard to recognize you and connect your name and your face.\nWhen I call your name, you can say something about yourself. No need to be long, couple of seconds are good."

We learn how to code for doing data science, not for understanding computer systems and structures.\n\nOf course we will not cover every detail form A to Z of DS in one semester becuase DS is such a huge subject, just like computer science. It’s impossible to learn CS in one semester by just taking intro to CS, right? So we’ll just learn the basic and essential concepts and tools used is DS."

Now I want to talk about the difference between mapping and setting.\nFirst, the aesthetic options such as color, size, shape, alpha can be used in both mapping and setting.\nWhen we use these options in mapping arguments, wrapped by aes() function, we actually map these options to some variables. In other words, we use those options to represents the values of the variables. Like here, the point size is used to represent the city mpg, the different point transparency are for different car years.\nSo there is a mapping between aesthetics options and variables.\nAlright setting. When we use the aesthetics options as a geometry setting, the aesthetics are pure decoration of your plot, the aesthetics are not used to represent any other variable values.\nLook at the example here. If we want to set point size at 5 and point transparency at 0.5, we put size = 5, alpha = 0.5 in the geometry function geom_point(), not in the mapping argument.\nAnd the result is that, all the points in the scatter plot will have size 5 and alpha 0.5.

Inside the parenthesis, we put the row variable ~ column variable.\nSo here, drive values, 4, f, r defines the rows, and cylinder values 4, 5, 6, 8 defines the columns.\nAnd each smaller plot is a scatter plot with some value of drive and some value of cylinder.\nFor example, the top right one is the scatter plot of hwy mpg and displacement when drive is 4 and cylinder is 8."

Then we learn data importing, data visualization and data wrangling using both R and Python. The second half of the course focuses on several basic simulation and machine learning methods, including Monte Carlo simulation, linear regression, K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, principal component analysis, and K-means clustering. We learn R tidyverse and tidymodels packages. For Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn libraries are introduced.",

If we assume this is a randomly selected group of 30 people, what is the chance that at least two people have the same birthday? Here we use a Monte Carlo simulation. For simplicity, we assume nobody was born on February 29.\n\n\n\nNote that birthdays can be represented as numbers between 1 and 365, so a sample of 30 birthdays can be obtained like this:\n\n\nn &lt;- 30\nbdays &lt;- sample(x = 1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)\n\n\nTo check if in this particular set of 30 people we have at least two with the same birthday, we can use the function duplicated(), which returns TRUE whenever an element of a vector is a duplicate. Here is an example:\n\n\nduplicated(c(1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 5))\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nThe second time 1 and 3 appear, we get a TRUE.\n\nTo check if two birthdays were the same, we simply use the any() and duplicated() functions like this:\n\n\nany(duplicated(bdays))\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nIn this case, we see that it did happen. At least two people had the same birthday.\nTo estimate the probability of a shared birthday in the group, repeat this experiment by sampling sets of 30 birthdays 10000 times, and find the relative frequency of the event that at least two people had the same birthday.\n\n## code\n# set.seed(your ID number)"

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n\n\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n\n\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\n\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

And yes, it is a comma-separated-value or csv file.\nFixed width text files are special cases of text files where the format is specified by column widths, pad character and left/right alignment. Column widths are measured in units of characters. For example, if you have data in a text file where the first column always has exactly 10 characters, and the second column has exactly 5, the third has exactly 12 (and so on), this would be categorized as a fixed width text file."

We want x to be double and the period is actually a missing value.\nImaging that if you have thousands of lines, you could very easily miss that period.\nA column with elements having different types, they’ll be coerced to the most flexible type.

In row 6 and col x, we expect a double but it is actually a dot or period, which is a character, and so R treats it as NA, which is exactly what I want to do.\nBut R send a message telling us about this, and make sure this is what we want to do.\nThis option might be preferable if you cannot scan your data file, or don;t know what convention is being used for missing values in your data file, but you happen to know your column types.\nThe downside of this is that, here, Not applicable and 9999, they are all treated as valid character values, and they are not missing values. So be careful about this. You may need to manually clean your data."

    "text": "A Little History of Data Science\n\nIn 1985, Dr. Jeff Wu used the term Data Science for the first time as an alternative name for Statistics.  \n\n\n\n\nThe first question is What is DS? Actually this is a really hard question to answer, at least at this moment.\n\nOriginally, DS was proposed to replace statistics. DS is just another name or maybe better name for statistics.\n\n\nBut still at that time, nobody cares. Statisticians are weird guys in math departments who deal with proofs and theorems and sometimes real data, and they are stubborn, not willing to change. But if you wiki the definition of statistics, statistics is a science of data, and you tell me what is the difference of science of data and data science?\n\n\nUsing this definition, DS becomes a broader term than statistics. Anything related to data can be a part of data sicence, while statistics now becomes a narrower subject focusing on inference and data analysis part.\n\nHere shows the google trend of DS. When I was in college or beginning of PHD studies, very few people used DS as a term. And all of sudden, DS become more and more popular, and everybody is talking about it."

No more copy and paste.\nThis greatly saves lots of time. Also, it reduces the chance of making mistakes of copying and pasting, and increases reproducibility of your study, meaning that your code can produce exactly the same result shown in your document.\nLiterate Programming"

What are the changes?\nHow do we set global chunk options to not show the code in every chunk in the document?\nOnce done, commit with message “04-codechunk” and push your work to GitHub."
