- Hello everyone, how are you? I hope you have a great winter break. Welcome to 3570 Introduction to Data Science course. I am your instructor Cheng-Han Yu.  

- First thing first. Get to know each other. Let me first introduce my self. I was born and grew up in Taipei, Taiwan, my home country, which is a island right next to China. Taipei is a big city in terms of population. It is about the same population size as Chicago. This building is called Taipei 101, which is the tallest building in Taiwan.

::: notes
After college, working and doing military service for several years, I came to the US for my PhD degree. Originally I would like to study economics, but then I switched my major to statistics. 

- I got my master degree in economics from Indiana University Bloomington, then I transferred to UC Santa Cruz to finish my PhD studies. 
- Then I spent two years doing my postdoctoral research at Rice University in Houston, Texas.
- Finally, in fall 2020, I came to Marquette as an assistant professor.
- Midwest/Indiana-West/California-South/Texas-Midwest/Wisconsin
- Been to any one of these universities/cities? 
- The most beautiful campus.
- Who are international students? I can totally understand how hard studying and living in another country. Feel free to share your stories or difficulties, and I am more than happy to help you if you have any questions.
- Poor listening and speaking skills. I was shy. 
- OK so, this is my background. How about you introducing yourself as well. You can share anything, your major, hobbies, your favorite food, what do you want to do after graduation, anything, 
- I have the class list. I'd like to learn your face and remember your name. You know, you all wear a mask. It's hard to recognize you and connect your name and your face. 
- When I call your name, you can say something about yourself. No need to be long, couple of seconds are good.

::: notes
- This is a real case happened last semester. A student of my class sent her homework of another class linear systems to me because the instructor of that course also has last name Yu, and she messed up. So if you remember to add course number in the subject line, it will greatly reduce the possibility of sending a wrong message. And it will save your time and my time, and so we all can work more efficiently. Right?

## What is This Course?
- **Every** *aspect of doing a practical data science project, from importing data to deploying what we learn from data*.
 
 
. . .

`r emo::ji("question")` **What are prerequisites?**  
`r emo::ji("point_right")` COSC 1010 (Intro Programming) and MATH 4720 (Intro Stats) or MATH 2780 (Intro Regression)

<br>

. . .

`r emo::ji("question")` **Is this like another intro stats course?**  
`r emo::ji("point_right")` No. Statistics and data science are closely related.  

. . .

Nowadays  
`r emo::ji("point_right")` Data science is a *broader* subject than statistics.  

. . .

`r emo::ji("point_right")` Statistics focuses more on *analyzing and learning from data*, a part of the entire workflow of data science.


<br>

. . .


`r emo::ji("question")` **Is this like another intro CS or programming course?**  
`r emo::ji("point_right")` Absolutely not. We learn how to **code for doing data science**, not for understanding computer systems and structures.

::: notes
- Of course we will not cover every detail form A to Z of DS in one semester becuase DS is such a huge subject, just like computer science. It's impossible to learn CS in one semester by just taking intro to CS, right? So we'll just learn the basic and essential concepts and tools used is DS.

## Grading Policy &#x2728;

  +   **30%** In-class lab exercises and participation.
  
  +   **30%** Homework
  
  +   **15%** Midterm mini project
  
  +   **25%** Final project competition
  
  +   *Extra credit opportunities*

<!-- Depending on the progress of the course,  -->
<!-- - There may be a midterm project proposal presentation, if time permitted.  -->
- `r emo::ji("x")` You have to participate in the final presentation in order to pass the course.
- `r emo::ji("x")` You will **NOT** be allowed to do any extra credit projects/homework/exam to compensate for a poor grade. 
<!-- - I may use class participation to make grade adjustments at the end of the semester. -->


## Grade-Percentage Conversion

- $[x, y)$ means greater than or equal to $x$ and less than $y$. For example, 94.0 is in [94, 100] and the grade is A and 93.8 is in [90, 94) and the grade is A-.

```{r}
letter <- c("A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-",
                       "D+", "D", "F")
percentage <- c("[94, 100]", "[90, 94)", "[87, 90)", "[84, 87)", "[80, 84)",
                "[77, 80)", "[74, 77)", "[70, 74)", 
                "[65, 70)", "[60, 65)", "[0, 60)")
grade_dist <- data.frame(Grade = letter, Percentage = percentage)
library(kableExtra)
knitr::kable(grade_dist, longtable = TRUE, format = "html", align = 'l') %>% kable_styling(position = "center", font_size = 36)
```


## Lab Exercises (30%)

- Graded as **Complete/Incomplete** and used as evidence of attendance and participation.

- Allowed to have **one** incomplete lab exercise without any penalty.

- Beyond that, **2%** grade percentage will be taken off for each missing/incomplete exercise.

- You will create a RStudio project in [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud) saving all of your lab exercises. (We'll go through know-how together)

<!-- - `r emo::ji("x")` **No make-up lab exercises** for any reason. -->


## Homework (30%)

- The homework assignments are individual. Submit your own work. 

- `r emo::ji("x")` **You may not share answers/code with your classmates**.

## Q & A

<!-- `r emo::ji("question")` **Will this course require any Textbook(s) or other materials to be purchased?**   -->
<!-- `r emo::ji("point_right")` No required textbooks. All resources are free on line! -->


<!-- <br> -->

<!-- . . . -->

`r emo::ji("question")` **K: I hope to learn more about programming. R: I’m looking forward to learning more about what data science consists of rather than just learning a programming language.**  
`r emo::ji("point_right")` To make sure everyone is on the same page, first couple of weeks is about learning R and Python syntax. After spring break, we focus on modeling and machine learning methods.

<br>

. . .

`r emo::ji("question")` **What do you think will be the most interesting part of the course?**  
`r emo::ji("point_right")` I love data visualization and web development.

<br>

. . .

<!-- `r emo::ji("question")` **If this course is a joint label between COSC and MATH, is there a difference between any particular class section or other that we may have registered for?**   -->
<!-- `r emo::ji("point_right")` No difference. MATH 3570 and COSC 3570 are exactly the same course. -->

`r emo::ji("question")` **D: Do I need good coding skills to be able to succeed?** **G: How much of this class is about coding?**

`r emo::ji("point_right")` We'll learn *basic* syntax for doing data science step by step.

<br>

. . .

`r emo::ji("question")` **What kind of time estimate do you believe most students should spend on reading + assignments for the course?**  
`r emo::ji("point_right")` Everyone is different. The more the better.



## Q & A

`r emo::ji("question")` **What kind of projects will we be doing for this course?**  
`r emo::ji("point_right")` Any project related to data works. You propose one to me. We discuss it, then decide.


<br>

. . .

`r emo::ji("question")` **Will this class help me better understand how to code proficiently?**  
`r emo::ji("point_right")` As you learn to speak a foreign language, you need to code a lot, frequently and constantly in order to be proficient in any programming language. No shortcut.

<br>

. . .

`r emo::ji("question")` **Do you know of any internships or research positions offered through Marquette University that incorporate the skills learned in this Data Science course?**  
`r emo::ji("point_right")` Quite many. Northwestern Mutual, Direct Supply, for example. I'll share intern info with you if I get any.

<!-- How can I be successful in your class? -->

<!-- From what I've researched online, it appears that this course mainly focuses on collecting and analyzing data. Visualizing this data is also important, but I'm confused about whether this is an outdated description of the field or the real deal. -->

<!-- - Are we going to use Python as the primary programming language for this course? - Do I need good coding skills to be able to succeed in this course? - Will we have paper assignments from time to time? -->
