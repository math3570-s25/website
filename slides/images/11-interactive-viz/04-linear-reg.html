Repeatedly performing this to get a sequence of points x(0),x(1),x(2),x(3),… until the certain stopping criterion is reached. Most algorithms differ in terms of how to move from the current point x(k) to the next, better target point x(k+1). This may depend on the smoothness or structure of f, constrains on the domain, computational complexity, memory limitation, and many others.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>When we only supply the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/optim.html">optim()</a></code> function the objective function definition <code>fn =</code>, it will internally numerically approximate the gradient. Sometimes this is not preferred due to computational reasons. And when you do have the theoretical gradient, it is likely to be more accurate than numerically approximated values. Hence, as long as the gradient itself does not cost too much compute, we may take advantage of it. We could supply the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/optim.html">optim()</a></code> function using the gradient <code>gr =</code>. This is the example we used previously:</p>
